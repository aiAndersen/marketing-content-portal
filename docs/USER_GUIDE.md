# User Guide: Natural Language Search

## Welcome to the Marketing Content Portal!

This guide will help you search through 636+ pieces of marketing content using natural language queries.

---

## How It Works

Instead of remembering exact titles or browsing through hundreds of items, just ask questions in plain English!

**Example**:
- Instead of: *Filtering by Type="Customer Story" AND State="NV"*
- Just type: *"Show me customer stories from Nevada"*

The system uses AI (Claude or GPT) to understand your question and find the right content.

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Search

Type any keyword in the search box:

```

## Advanced Search Tips

### 1. Be Specific

❌ **Too vague**: "school stuff"  
✅ **Better**: "customer stories about high schools"

### 2. Use Multiple Keywords

❌ **Single word**: "students"  
✅ **Better**: "student engagement tracking tools"

### 3. Specify Content Type

❌ **Generic**: "show me content"  
✅ **Better**: "show me customer stories and case studies"

### 4. Combine Filters

Use the checkboxes + search query together:
1. Check "Customer Story" and "Video"
2. Type: "New Hampshire schools"
3. Hit Search

### 5. Try Different Phrasings

If you don't find what you need, rephrase:
- "Nevada content" → "customer stories from NV"
- "WBL" → "work-based learning"
- "CCR" → "college and career readiness"

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

**Try**:
1. Remove filters and search again

3. Check spelling
4. Try broader terms ("schools" instead of "school districts")

### Results seem wrong

**Try**:
1. Use more specific keywords
2. Add content type filters
3. Rephrase your query
4. Use quotes for exact phrases

### Search is slow

- AI natural language processing takes 1-2 seconds
- This is normal for complex queries
- Simple keyword search is faster (no AI needed)
