## Competitor Analysis

### 1. Naviance (PowerSchool) - Market Leader, Legacy Platform

**Market Position:** Largest CCR platform, acquired by PowerSchool (now Vista Equity)

**Pricing:**
- ~$1-3 per student annually
- Typical 5-year contracts ~$77,000 for mid-size districts
- "Nickel and diming" complaints for add-on features

**Documented User Complaints (from G2, Reddit, public reviews):**

| Issue | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Poor Customer Support** | "Terrible support" - canned responses, no real solutions |
| **Dated Interface** | "Everything seems hidden behind tabs" - confusing UX |
| **Privacy Lawsuits** | Class action (May 2024) for student data collection practices |
| **Limited WBL** | Work-based learning is an add-on, not integrated |
| **Siloed Tools** | Separate modules don't talk to each other |
