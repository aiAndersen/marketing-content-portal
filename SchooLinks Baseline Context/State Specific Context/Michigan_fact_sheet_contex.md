# SchooLinks x Michigan (K–12) — Comprehensive Enablement + Messaging Guide  
*Purpose:* A Michigan-specific, state-terminology-first guide to how SchooLinks supports Michigan’s K–12 college & career readiness (CCR) requirements and initiatives (EDP, Talent Portfolio, CTE/Perkins V, MMC, MME, dual enrollment/EMC, and outcome reporting).  
*Notes on language:* Michigan uses **EDP (Educational Development Plan)** and **Talent Portfolio**. In SchooLinks enablement materials you may see internal feature names; for Michigan-facing materials, always lead with Michigan terms.

## 1) Michigan’s CCR “why” (state strategy context)

### Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan
Michigan’s statewide strategic plan centers on better outcomes for learners and communities, with goals/metrics and an emphasis on partnerships and measurable progress. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
**SchooLinks tie-in:** SchooLinks helps districts *operationalize* strategy by connecting daily student CCR activities (career exploration, planning, WBL, credentials, applications) to **real-time reporting** for cabinet/board storytelling.

### Sixty by 30 (postsecondary attainment goal)
Michigan’s **Sixty by 30** goal: by **2030**, **60% of working-age Michiganders** will have a certificate or college degree. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
**SchooLinks tie-in:** SchooLinks supports the pipeline leading to Sixty by 30—helping districts increase:
- **EDP quality and completion** (plans + revisions)
- **Dual credit / EMC participation** documentation
- **CTE credential attainment**
- **FAFSA completion and scholarship engagement**
- **Postsecondary outcomes and alumni follow-up** (where used)

---

## 2) Michigan’s required student planning: EDP (Educational Development Plan)

### What Michigan requires (EDP)
Michigan requires districts/PSAs to provide the opportunity for **every student** to:
- **Develop an EDP in grade 7**
- **Review and revise annually through grade 12** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
Michigan law (MCL 380.1278b) includes expectations that the EDP is developed/revised under qualified supervision and connected to readiness information and career pathway planning. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

### What the EDP is (how Michigan describes it)
Michigan positions the EDP as a “living” planning artifact—updated as interests/strengths become clearer—and connected to career exploration and pathway decisions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

---

## 3) Michigan’s Talent Portfolio requirement

### What Michigan requires (Talent Portfolio)
Michigan’s career development targets explicitly include **Target 8: Talent Portfolio**—a record that showcases **experiences, proficiencies, certifications, and accomplishments** to demonstrate marketable skills to employers or admissions. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
Many Michigan CCR frameworks and ISD guidance reinforce that a Talent Portfolio is developed alongside the EDP and revisited across grades. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

---

## 4) Michigan Career Development Model (MCDM) alignment

### What MCDM is
The **Michigan Career Development Model (MCDM)** is the state’s legislatively guided framework for career awareness, exploration, and preparation—engaging students and their support networks with intentional career development learning. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

### Key Michigan implementation idea
MCDM is commonly implemented through a **district scope-and-sequence** of CCR learning targets (career awareness → exploration → preparation), with EDP + Talent Portfolio as recurring anchors.

**SchooLinks tie-in:** SchooLinks is strongest when districts set up a **Michigan-aligned scope & sequence** that:
- assigns grade-level CCR tasks (career exploration, goal setting, experience documentation, portfolio artifacts)
- ensures **annual EDP review/revision** is visible and auditable
- gives counselors/CTE/WBL staff and families a shared, trackable workflow

(Internal platform messaging emphasizes “digitize activities” + “live, actionable data” for compliance and support. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8})

---

## 5) SchooLinks features mapped to Michigan terminology (no internal jargon)

### A) “EDP workflow” in SchooLinks (Michigan-facing)
**Michigan term:** Educational Development Plan (EDP)  
**What SchooLinks does for Michigan:**
- Houses a **student-facing plan** that collects EDP elements from completed CCR activities (career exploration, goals, planning artifacts, resume/portfolio items, reflections).
- Supports district-defined **annual review and revision checkpoints** (grade 7 creation + annual updates).
- Enables **family engagement** through review/sign-off workflows (Michigan-friendly framing: “family review of EDP artifacts and portfolio evidence”).

> Why this matters in Michigan: it turns the EDP from a “once-a-year event” into an always-current record of planning + evidence.

(Platform en:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} student plan feature as a state-mandate tracker with gathered artifacts and collaboration/signatures. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10})

---

### B) “Talent Portfolio” in SchooLinks (Michigan-facing)
**Michigan term:** Talent Portfolio  
**What SchooLinks does for Michigan:**
- Provides a digital space to collect **experiences, accomplishments, credentials, and work samples** aligned to Michigan’s portfolio intent. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Makes it easy for students to maintain portfolio evidence continuously (WBL logs, reflections, artifacts, badges/credentials).

**Best Michigan message:**  
“Your EDP is the plan; your Talent Portfolio is the proof.”

---

### C) Michigan Career Clusters (17) and career exploration
Michigan’s model references exploration across **Michigan’s 17 Career Clusters** as part of structured career exploration and planning. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
**What SchooLinks does:**
- Career exploration experiences that conne:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}rs → pathways → opportunities (including local/regional lenses where configured).
- Helps students record “why this fits me” data and supports counselor conversations.

(Enablement positioning: career center uses labor market data sources and supports local opportunity discovery. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14})

---

## 6) Michigan Merit Curriculum (MMC) + graduation planning

### Michigan requirement context
Michigan’s graduation expectations are anchored in the **Michigan Merit Curriculum** and related statutory language; EDP is explicitly referenced in MMC guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

### SchooLinks: graduation requirement clarity + multi-year planning
SchooLinks supports **multi-year course planning** and helps stakeholders see progress toward graduation requirements (district/state-configured), improving clarity despite changing rules and staff turnover. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

Key product truth to keep Michigan messaging accurate:
- Course planning in SchooLinks is a **forward planning / 4-year plan** tool (not a master schedule builder). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- SchooLinks can support longer-horizon planning (enablement references a 6-year planner capability vs some competitors). :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

**Michigan positioning:**
- “Align course plans to graduation requirements and postsecondary goals captured in the EDP.”
- “Make graduation plann:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}rs, and families—without spreadsheets.”

---

## 7) Michigan assessments: MME (Michigan Merit Examination) and readiness signals

### What MME includes
MME is Michigan’s grade 11 assessment event that includes:
- SAT (with Essay referenced in reporting materials)
- ACT WorkKeys (work skills)
- M-STEP Science and Social Studies (as part of the MME reporting package) :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

The MME parent report describes these required parts and how results reflect performance levels. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

### WorkKeys + National Career Readiness Certificate (NCRC)
MME reporting materials explain that WorkKeys results can qualify students for an **NCRC** (bronze/silver/gold/platinu:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}levels. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

### Michigan student identifiers (UIC) in assessment ecosystems
Michigan reporting guidance notes that the :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}is the identifier used across systems; the MME guide equates the SASID to Michigan’s UIC via MSDS. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}Michigan-safe language):**
- SchooLinks can serve as the district’s **CCR “single view”** where assessment indicators used for advising can live alongside EDP/Talent Portfolio/WBL and course planning—so counselors can intervene earlier.

---

## 8) Michigan CTE + Perkins V reporting (including 5S1) and CTEIS realities

### Perkins V indicator that Michigan highlights: 5S1
Michigan defines **Program Quality—Recognized Postsecondary Credential (Secondary) (5S1)** as the % of CTE concentrators graduating having attained a recognized postsecondar:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}tion, apprenticeship completion). :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}  

### Michigan’s CTEIS system context
Michig:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}formation System)** as the state system collecting information for state-approved CTE programs and sharing dates, reports, and resources. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}  

### SchooLinks: what Michigan CTE l:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31} Work-based learning participation + documentation
- Employer/partner coordination
- Evidence collection for student readiness
- Reducing reporting burden (Perkins indicators + audits)

(Enablement persona framing: CTE directors :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}need pathway/WBL tools. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33})

**SchooLinks CTE positioning for Michigan:**
- Track **approved credentials** at the student level (credential lists are district/region configured to match programs).
- Maintain a **digital evidence trail** (documents, reflections, evaluations) supporting credential attainment and WBL participation.
- Provide **role-based reporting** so CTE directors, counselors, and administrators aren’t dependent on “spreadsheet season.”

(Internal product positioning emphasizes centralized workflows and real-time drill-down reporting for state indicator tracking. :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34})

---

## 9) Work-Based Learning (WBL) and employer/community engagement

### Michigan reality
Michigan districts often run WBL through CTE programs, local partnerships, and career readiness initiatives. Documentation and evidence collection are constant friction points.

### SchooLinks support
SchooLinks supports:
- **WBL opportunity management** (district-created opportunities + partner-posted opportunities where enabled)
- Student **experience tracking** (hours, reflections, supervisor feedback, artifacts)
- Employer engagement via structured workflows

(Enablement differentiators highlight WBL program management and partner collaboration as a key strength. :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35})

---

## 10) Dual Enrollment + Early Middle College (EMC) (Michigan-facing guidance)

Michigan districts commonly need to track:
- Dual enrollment participation, credits earned, :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}comes
- Early Middle College pathway progress and postsecondary credit accumulation
- Alignment to EDP goals and career cluster/pathway choices

**SchooLinks Michigan positioning (safe and practical):**
- Store dual credit / EMC participation as structured student data and/or portfolio artifacts.
- Connect participation back to the **EDP** (goal alignment + next steps) and the **Talent Portfolio** (evidence of readiness).

*(If you want this section to match your district’s specific EMC model structures, build a Michigan EMC “data dictionary” inside Scho:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}ds.)*

---

## 11) College access: applications, transcripts, FAFSA, scholarships

### College applications + transcript workflows
SchooLinks includes a college application management workflow that supports transcript sending and integrations (commonly via Parchment and Common App where configured). :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}  

**Michigan messaging:**
- “Reduce counselor office bottlenecks during application season.”
- “Give students and families a clear checklist tied to the EDP and postsecondary plan.”

### FAFSA and scholarships
Many Michigan districts run FAFSA/scholarship campaigns as part of CCR goals. SchooLinks supports:
- Student task tracking and reminders:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}n (where enabled)
- Counselor visibility into completion and follow-up needs

(Enablement demo flow includes FAFSA & scholarship as a core CCR walkthrough element. :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40})

---

## 12) Reporting for Michigan stakeholders (what each role cares about)

### A) Counselors / Career Advisors
**Michigan needs:** manage caseload, ensure EDP annual revisions, document supports, communicate with families, prevent students from “falling through the cracks.” :contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}  
**SchooLinks value:** unified student record + task completion visibility + messaging.

### B) CTE Directors / WBL Coordinators
**Michigan needs:** track WBL participation, employer partners, credentials, and Perkins-aligned evidence; reduce paperwork. :contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}  
**SchooLinks value:** one workflow for opportunities → participation → documentation → reporting.

### C) Superintendents / Cabinet
**Michigan needs:** show progress toward Top 10 plan priorities and Sixty by 30 pipeline outcomes; provide board-ready reporting without manual compilation. :contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44} value:** “strategic initiative reporting” backed by live student-level detail.

(Enablement messaging emphasizes “live, actionable data” and “simplify state compliance.” :contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45})

---

## 13) Integration points that matter in Michigan

### SIS + Michigan identifiers
Michigan districts rely on consistent student identifiers (UIC via MSDS) across reporting ecosystems. :contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}  
MME reporting guidance reinforces identifier alignment across systems. :contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}

**SchooLinks implication:** stro:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}nsistent IDs are essential to:
- accurate caseload reporting
- indicator dashboards
- credential and participation tracking
- postsecondary outcome matching (where used)

### CTEIS reality
Michigan’s state CTE reporting ecosystem runs through CTEIS for state-approved programs. :contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}SchooLinks implication:** districts can use SchooLinks to manage day-to-day evidence and readiness tracking, then align exports/entries to state systems based on local process.

---

## 14) Michigan-ready messaging (copy blocks you can reuse)

### One-sent:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}higan)
SchooLinks is the Michigan-aligned CCR platform that helps districts **meet EDP + Talent Portfolio requirements**, strengthen **CTE/Perkins credential attainment**, and unify **course planning, WBL, and postsecondary planning**—with reporting that’s ready for counselors *and* cabinet.

### “EDP + Talent Portfolio” elevator pitch
Michigan requires every student to start an **EDP in 7th grade** and **review and revise it annually through 12th**. :contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}  
SchooLinks turns that requirement into a simple, student-owned workflow: students complete meaningful CCR activities, Scho:contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}utputs into the **EDP** and the **Talent Portfolio**—so districts can show both the plan *and* the proof.

### CTE/Perkins pitch (5S1)
Michigan’s Perkins accountability includes **5S1—recognized postsecondary credentials** for CTE concentrators. :contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}  
SchooLinks helps districts track credentials and the evidence behind them (WBL experiences, art:contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}and report with confidence.

## 15) Implementation checklist (Michigan-first)

1. **Define your Michigan scope & sequence** by grade band (7–8, 9–10, 11–12) aligned to MCDM.
2. Configure the **EDP structure**:
   - Grade 7 creation milestone
   - Annual review/revision checkpoints through grade 12 :contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}  
3. Configure **Talent Portfolio categories** (experiences, awards, credentials, work samples, reflections). :contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}  
4. Configure **career cluster** exploration expectations (Michigan’s 17 clusters). :contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}  
5. Align **graduation requirement views** to district/Michigan expectations (MMC-aligned planning). :contentReference[oaicite:59]{index=59}  
6. Decide how you will track **CTE credentials** for Perkins reporting (including 5S1 definitions). :contentReference[oaicite:60]{index=60}  
7. Define WBL workflows: opportunity posting → approval → hours/artifacts → evaluations → portfolio inclusion.
8. Confirm identifier/data hygiene (UIC/MSDS alignment) if importing/exporting data across systems. :contentReference[oaicite:61]{index=61}
