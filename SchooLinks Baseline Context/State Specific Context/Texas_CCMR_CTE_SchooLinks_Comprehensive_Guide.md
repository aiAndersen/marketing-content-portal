# Texas K–12 College, Career, and Military Readiness (CCMR) + CTE: Terminology, Policy Context, and How SchooLinks Supports It

*This guide is based on the Texas-focused materials you provided (including “Texas College & Career Readiness Initiatives and CTE Alignment (2025)”, platform collateral, and product training notes). It’s written for Texas district leaders, CCMR/accountability teams, counseling teams, and CTE leaders. It is **not** a substitute for TEA manuals or legal guidance.*

---

## 1) What Texas is optimizing for (and why it’s hard)

Texas has built a tightly connected system where **graduation planning**, **college readiness**, **CTE pathway completion**, **industry credentials**, and **accountability funding** are intertwined:

- **A–F Accountability**: CCMR is a major component of high school accountability. Texas raised the CCMR performance bar starting with the 2023 ratings (e.g., an “A” in CCMR requires a very high percent of graduates meeting at least one indicator). fileciteturn1file7  
- **Outcomes-based funding (HB 3 Outcomes Bonus)**: Districts can earn additional funding when graduates—especially high-need student groups—meet CCMR outcomes. fileciteturn1file2  
- **CTE + Credential alignment (HB 773 phase-in)**: Career-ready CCMR credit is increasingly tied to **earning an approved Industry-Based Certification (IBC)** *and* completing aligned **CTE Program of Study** coursework (concentrator/completer status). fileciteturn1file3  
- **Lagging compliance tools**: TEA’s CCMR Tracker is helpful but inherently “after-the-fact,” creating a need for **real-time, in-year** tracking to intervene before deadlines. fileciteturn1file10  

That combination creates a practical reality in Texas:
> You can’t manage CCMR/CTE with spreadsheets anymore—because the state’s definition of “ready” is both **multi-indicator** and increasingly **course-sequence dependent**.

## 2) Texas acronyms and “must-know” terminology (Glossary)

### Accountability & outcomes
- **TEA**: Texas Education Agency.
- **A–F Accountability**: Texas accountability ratings framework (Domain system for campuses/districts). CCMR is a major component for high schools. fileciteturn1file7  
- **CCMR (College, Career, and Military Readiness)**: A set of indicators TEA uses to determine whether a graduate is prepared for postsecondary education, workforce, or military. Texas defines ~10 indicators across college, career, and military readiness. fileciteturn1file7  
- **CCMR Domain Cut Points**: The thresholds for A/B/C/D/F in the CCMR domain. Recent materials note the state raised the bar beginning with 2023 ratings, pushing districts toward “nearly every graduate” being CCMR-ready. fileciteturn1file10  
- **Outcomes Bonus (HB 3)**: Outcomes-based funding incentives for graduates meeting CCMR outcomes (often emphasizing high-need groups). fileciteturn1file2  

### Graduation plans & course pathways (HB 5 world)
- **Foundation High School Program (FHSP)**: The default Texas graduation framework created by HB 5; includes endorsements and Distinguished Level of Achievement considerations. fileciteturn1file2  
- **Endorsements (HB 5)**: Student graduation plan focus areas:
  - STEM
  - Business & Industry
  - Public Services
  - Arts & Humanities
  - Multidisciplinary  
  Endorsements connect course sequencing to a student’s future goal/pathway. fileciteturn1file2  

### CTE and Programs of Study (POS)
- **CTE (Career and Technical Education)**: Coursework and programs preparing students for career pathways, credentials, and postsecondary options.
- **Program of Study (POS)**: A structured sequence of CTE courses (often described as **Levels 1–4**) aligned to a career cluster/pathway and tied to endorsements. fileciteturn1file2  
- **CTE participant / concentrator / completer**:
  - These are state-defined status labels based on the number/level of completed courses in a POS.
  - Texas policy direction increasingly uses these statuses to validate “career-ready” CCMR outcomes when paired with an approved credential. fileciteturn1file3  

### Credentials & career readiness
- **IBC (Industry-Based Certification)**: A credential from TEA’s approved list that can count for CCMR career readiness (and is increasingly expected to be earned *within* an aligned POS). fileciteturn1file3  
- **Approved IBC List**: TEA’s list of certifications eligible for accountability. Materials describe a shift to a synchronized **five-year update cycle** (e.g., a 2025–2029 list). fileciteturn1file3  
- **Level I/II Certificates**: Another form of credential/certificate referenced in CCMR career readiness definitions. fileciteturn1file7  

### CCR school models & key statewide initiatives
- **CCRSM (College & Career Readiness School Models)**: TEA models like:
  - **ECHS (Early College High School)**: Blends HS + college credit (up to 60 credits/associate degree pathways).
  - **P-TECH**: Blends HS + postsecondary + industry credentials + work-based learning in high-demand fields.  
  Materials note broad statewide adoption and strong outcomes. fileciteturn1file11  
- **FAFSA graduation requirement**: Texas requires seniors to complete FAFSA/TASFA or formally opt out to graduate (per provided materials). fileciteturn1file11  

### Data & compliance tools
- **TEA CCMR Tracker (Part I / Part II)**: A TEA reporting tool released in two parts yearly. Materials note a 2025 enhancement that adds a downloadable report listing earned IBCs, aligned POS, and CTE status (participant/concentrator/completer). fileciteturn1file10  
- **Lagging vs. real-time**: The TEA tracker is useful for verification/compliance, but districts still need in-year monitoring because TEA data arrives later in the cycle. fileciteturn1file10  
- **Perkins V**: Federal CTE compliance and reporting requirements (documentation like CTSO/advisory, WBL, etc. appear in the materials as common needs). fileciteturn1file6  
- **PEIMS**: Texas student data reporting system; districts often need exports and clean audit trails for state/federal reporting (referenced as an output need in the materials). fileciteturn1file6  

---

## 3) CCMR in practice: what districts must track

Per the Texas alignment materials, CCMR indicators include (at a high level):  
- **College readiness**: academic benchmarks (e.g., SAT/ACT, Texas Success Initiative assessments), college-level coursework (dual credit, AP/IB). fileciteturn1file7  
- **Career readiness**: industry-recognized certifications / Level I or II certificates, and related CTE completion requirements as policy shifts phase in. fileciteturn1file7 fileciteturn1file3  
- **Military readiness**: enlistment indicator. fileciteturn1file7  

**Key takeaway:** CCMR is *not* “one program.” It’s a **portfolio of indicators**—and success requires ensuring each graduate hits at least one indicator, with increasing emphasis on *aligned* CTE coursework for career-ready indicators. fileciteturn1file10  

---

## 4) The HB 773 shift: IBCs are no longer “standalone”

Your provided Texas materials describe a phase-in tied to HB 773:  

- **Class of 2024**: IBC + at least one advanced course in the aligned POS  
- **Class of 2025**: IBC + CTE concentrator status (≥2 courses in the POS)  
- **Class of 2026**: IBC + CTE completer status (3+ courses incl. advanced) fileciteturn1file3  

**Why it matters for operations**
- Counselors can’t “fix CCMR” in senior year if students are off-sequence in their POS.
- CTE teams can’t treat credentials as independent from course planning.
- Data teams must track **course history + planned coursework + credential evidence** to forecast who will be compliant/CCMR-ready.

---

## 5) TEA’s CCMR Tracker: great for audit, not enough for day-to-day intervention

Materials describe:
- Tracker released in **two parts** each year (Part I and Part II).
- A 2025 enhancement adds a download showing **earned IBCs**, **aligned programs of study**, and **CTE status** (participant/concentrator/completer). fileciteturn1file10  
- But the TEA tracker is **lagging** by nature—current-year accomplishments often don’t show until later reporting. fileciteturn1file10  

**Operational implication**
- Texas districts need a platform that can:
  1) track *in-year* progress, and  
  2) drive interventions (messaging, meetings, scheduling) *before* the reporting window closes.

## 6) Where SchooLinks fits in Texas (the “crosswalk”)

### The SchooLinks position (Texas-specific)
The Texas alignment document describes SchooLinks as an all-in-one CCR platform built to align with TEA definitions—supporting end-to-end planning, CCMR dashboards, CTE pathway logic, IBC management, and reporting. fileciteturn1file5  

### What that means in plain English
SchooLinks is designed to connect, in one workflow:

**Plan → Do → Prove → Report → Improve**
- **Plan**: Texas graduation plan + endorsement + POS-aligned course plan
- **Do**: career exploration, experiences/WBL, assessments, applications
- **Prove**: IBC evidence, course completion, student status flags
- **Report**: dashboards, exports for teams, audit trails
- **Improve**: interventions (messaging, tasking, meetings) based on gaps

---

## 7) SchooLinks features that directly map to Texas requirements

Below are SchooLinks capabilities explicitly referenced in your materials.

### A) Real-time CCMR dashboards (and drill-down to students)
- SchooLinks consolidates CCMR indicators (college, career, military) into a single dashboard for staff to identify gaps early and act before deadlines. fileciteturn1file6  
- The approach emphasizes “live and actionable” data—moving from analytics to action without spreadsheet workflows. fileciteturn1file14  

**Texas value**
- Protect and improve A–F CCMR performance by intervening with the “not yet ready” population early.

### B) Texas graduation plan + endorsement validation (HB 5 operationalized)
- Students build course plans in a guided planner aligned to Texas graduation requirements.
- Validation rules catch missing requirements (e.g., required credits) while students plan. fileciteturn1file6  

**Texas value**
- Fewer graduation plan errors; fewer last-minute “we can’t schedule that” surprises; better alignment between counseling + master scheduling.

### C) POS + CTE status automation (participant/concentrator/completer)
SchooLinks provides a **CTE Completer Dashboard** that:
- identifies completers using “Taken” and “Taken + Planned” views (confirm vs forecast),
- helps monitor POS selection gaps,
- enables bulk messaging and exports. fileciteturn1file4  

The Texas alignment materials also describe **auto-tagging** of concentrators/completers using Texas-defined course sequences and crosswalk logic. fileciteturn1file6  

**Texas value**
- Exactly what HB 773 requires: proof that credentials are earned within coherent coursework sequences.

### D) IBC management with proof and TEA list mapping
Materials describe that SchooLinks:
- allows staff/teachers to record IBCs (including uploading proof/certificates),
- auto-matches to the TEA-approved IBC list,
- maintains audit trails for compliance. fileciteturn1file6  

**Texas value**
- Reduces manual crosswalks; easier audits; fewer “we earned it but can’t document it” issues.

### E) Work-based learning (WBL) + CTSO + advisory documentation
The Texas alignment document explicitly calls out SchooLinks support for:
- WBL hour logging (e.g., practicums),
- CTSO participation tracking,
- advisory board documentation to support Perkins needs. fileciteturn1file5  

**Texas value**
- Better CTE program management and documentation in one system rather than separate tools.

### F) FAFSA tracking + communications
SchooLinks materials describe being able to:
- see FAFSA completion status at a glance,
- drill down to the student list and message students/parents directly. fileciteturn1file14  

**Texas value**
- Directly supports the FAFSA/TASFA graduation requirement workflow by turning compliance into an outreach + tracking process. fileciteturn1file11  

### G) Personalized Graduation Plan (PGP) / Personalized Learning Plan (PLP)
SchooLinks training material describes the **Personalized Plan (PLP)** feature as the home for state-mandated annual student planning activities, with electronic signatures, and auto-completion based on student activity completion. In Texas, this aligns to the **Personal Graduation Plan (PGP)** concept. fileciteturn0file5  

**Texas value**
- Centralizes “mandated activities” (goals, assessments, portfolio items) into a trackable workflow tied to student planning.

### H) Core platform breadth (postsecondary planning + CTE + productivity)
Your feature list highlights major platform areas including:
- college search and planning tools,
- CTE features like certification tracking and pathway/endorsement tracking,
- staff productivity tools, communications, and analytics. fileciteturn1file16

**SchooLinks answer:** real-time CCMR dashboards with early gap identification. fileciteturn1file6  

### Pain point 2: “HB 773 is forcing us to align IBCs to POS completions—and we’re stuck in spreadsheets.”
**SchooLinks answer:** auto-tagging concentrator/completer status + CTE Completer Dashboard + IBC mapping and evidence. fileciteturn1file3 fileciteturn1file4 fileciteturn1file6  

### Pain point 3: “Course planning and endorsements are error-prone, especially with transfer credits and schedule changes.”
**SchooLinks answer:** Texas-aligned graduation plan validation, integrated course planning, and a unified student case file to support advising. fileciteturn1file6 fileciteturn1file14  

### Pain point 4: “FAFSA is required, but outreach is messy and documentation is scattered.”
**SchooLinks answer:** drill-down lists + bulk messaging to students/parents + tracking. fileciteturn1file14 fileciteturn1file11  

### Pain point 5: “CTE reporting and compliance is distributed across too many systems.”
**SchooLinks answer:** WBL/CTSO/advisory tracking + exports/audit trails aligned to reporting needs. fileciteturn1file5 fileciteturn1file6

## 9) Role-based “why it matters” messaging (Texas)

### Superintendent / Cabinet
- Protect A–F outcomes by identifying “CCMR gaps” early and moving students to at least one indicator.
- Support outcomes-based funding goals through better CCMR attainment tracking. fileciteturn1file2  

### Accountability / Data Teams
- Centralize indicator data and produce clean, exportable reporting datasets with less manual reconciliation. fileciteturn1file6  

### Directors of Counseling / CCMR
- Manage caseload priorities through dynamic student lists, tasks, and messaging (less spreadsheet triage). fileciteturn1file14  

### CTE Directors / Coordinators
- Forecast concentrators/completers from “Taken + Planned,” validate HB 773 alignment, and track credentials with evidence. fileciteturn1file4 fileciteturn1file3  

### Principals / Campus Leaders
- See campus-level completion gaps, assign responsibilities, and intervene with the right groups at the right time. fileciteturn1file14

## 10) Example Texas operating cadence (how districts typically use this)

> The goal is to keep all stakeholders working from the **same playbook** and the **same source of truth**.

### Fall (Aug–Oct)
- Confirm POS selection for all students
- Validate endorsement plans and course plans
- Start CCMR indicator monitoring for seniors (especially career-ready pathways requiring sequencing)

### Winter (Nov–Jan)
- Identify “at-risk of no indicator” seniors early
- Track IBC progress and evidence uploads
- Launch FAFSA campaign + track opt-outs

### Spring (Feb–May)
- Forecast CTE concentrator/completer and course completion status
- Audit credential + course alignment (HB 773)
- Use exports for internal accountability reviews and board updates

### Summer (Jun–Aug)
- Reconcile against TEA CCMR Tracker releases for verification
- Use findings to adjust pathway offerings, advising priorities, and master schedule planning for next year fileciteturn1file10

## 11) How SchooLinks compares to other Texas tools (high-level)

Your Texas alignment material frames a “tools landscape” where:
- TEA CCMR Tracker is compliance verification but lagging.
- Other platforms (e.g., Naviance, Xello) support parts of CCMR/CCR tracking with varying degrees of manual updating.
- SchooLinks is positioned as an all-in-one platform with deeper Texas-specific CTE + IBC + course planning alignment. fileciteturn1file9 fileciteturn1file5

## Appendix B: Suggested “Texas-ready” positioning lines (copy-paste)

- “With TEA’s CCMR bar higher and HB 773 tying IBCs to Program of Study completion, spreadsheets can’t keep up. SchooLinks gives you real-time CCMR + CTE pathway tracking in one place.”
- “SchooLinks auto-tags concentrators/completers and associates IBC proofs to the TEA-approved list—so you can intervene now, not months later in the TEA tracker.”
- “Turn CCMR data into action: drill into the student list, bulk message families, and document progress in one workflow.”
