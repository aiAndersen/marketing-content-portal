# SchooLinks Context (Baseline Training + Knowledge Base Notes)
*A comprehensive, agent-ready brief on what SchooLinks is, who it’s for, what it replaces, what it does, why it wins, and how to message it.*

---

## 1) What SchooLinks is (positioning)
SchooLinks is a **single college & career readiness (CCR) platform** designed to support **every student** (college-bound, career-bound, undecided) while giving **staff actionable workflows + real-time reporting** to meet district initiatives and **state/federal compliance** requirements. Core messaging emphasizes:  
- **Student-first design** that drives adoption  
- **Digitizing student activities** (not “scanning paper into a portal”)  
- **Live, actionable data** that lets counselors intervene (not just “report later”)  
- **Industry partner engagement** for real work-based learning (WBL)  
- **Service model for all stakeholders** (staff, students, families)  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Core belief:** “College & Career to us are equally important… SchooLinks doesn’t want your students on multiple platforms—everything should be in 1 place.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## 5) Core “problems we solve” (pain points → solution framing)

### 5.1 “We’re drowning in spreadsheets + disconnected systems”
**Pain**
- Staff manually compile readiness/indicator data across sources; time-consuming and inaccurate:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}

**SchooLinks solution**
- KRI centralizes sources and connects data *inside daily workflow*, not in a separate dashboard silo:contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}

### 5.2 “We only find out students missed requirements when it’s too late”
**Pain**
- Manual tracking happens only in reporting season (reactive):contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}

**SchooLinks solution**
- Proactive calculation + drill-down views + ability to intervene earlier:contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}

### 5.3 “Students don’t engage with our CCR tool”
**Pain**
- Traditional tools can require training and feel disconnected from student UX

**SchooLinks solution**
- “Student First Design Drives Organic Adoption” and “gamified system (Game of Life)” messaging:contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}

### 5.4 “Course planning is messy (choice slips, errors, high counselor load)”
**Pain**
- Students plan in scheduling system or paper choice slips → error-prone and time-consuming:contentReference[oaicite:59]{index=59}

**SchooLinks solution**
- Course Planner: step-by-step guide + real-time error checks + counselor review queues:contentReference[oaicite:60]{index=60}:contentReference[oaicite:61]{index=61}

### 5.5 “WBL is impossible to scale and document”
**Pain**
- Matching students + employers and tracking documentation is complex

**SchooLinks solution**
- Program management + placements lifecycle + documentation + timesheets in one place:contentReference[oaicite:62]{index=62}:contentReference[oaicite:63]{index=63}

---

## 6) Proof points & outcomes (what we can safely claim from internal materials)
> Use these as “evidence patterns” in agent responses; swap in specific district stories when available.

- SchooLinks content strategy calls out customer stories as cornerstone proof, including:
  - **Bow High School’s switch from Naviance** with measurable outcomes (explicitly referenced internally):contentReference[oaicite:64]{index=64}
  - **Elko County WBL growth** (referenced as a key proof point for WBL pages):contentReference[oaicite:65]{index=65}
  - **Solon / Richland** as examples for replacing spreadsheets for graduation tracking:contentReference[oaicite:66]{index=66}

- “Implementation success” is positioned as part of the product value: platform + implementation customized for engagement, utility, and reporting ROI (in Xello comparison doc).:contentReference[oaicite:67]{index=67}

---

## 7) Use cases (common prompts an AI agent should answer)

### 7.1 Switching from Naviance (or “Naviance alternative”)
**Typical district reality**
- Tool sprawl + low student engagement + staff admin burden + compliance pressure

**Agent framing**
- “SchooLinks has everything that Naviance, Xello, MajorClarity have—plus reduces clicks and unifies graduation tracking, industry partners/WBL, alumni, wellness, and CCR activities in one platform.”:contentReference[oaicite:68]{index=68}

**Migration narrative**
- Use scope & sequence to drive change management and student To-Dos (central plan for staff/students/families).:contentReference[oaicite:69]{index=69}

### 7.2 FAFSA completion
**What matters**
- Reaching the right students/families at the right time; events (FAFSA nights), reminders, tracking

**SchooLinks assets**
- Unified event scheduling includes FAFSA workshops alongside other events (equity: not college-only).:contentReference[oaicite:70]{index=70}
- Messaging capabilities (bulk/individual + mobile text).:contentReference[oaicite:71]{index=71}
- Xello comparison explicitly positions SchooLinks as supporting FAFSA education/tracking and related financial planning tooling (e.g., Game of Life).:contentReference[oaicite:72]{index=72}:contentReference[oaicite:73]{index=73}

### 7.3 Work-based learning (WBL) scale + compliance
**Common needs**
- Partner onboarding, placements, documentation, hours, evaluations, reporting

**SchooLinks solution**
- Program management + multiple opportunity sourcing paths + placement documentation + timesheets:contentReference[oaicite:74]{index=74}:contentReference[oaicite:75]{index=75}

### 7.4 Graduation tracking / “Are students on track?”
**Common needs**
- Graduation requirements by cohort, drill-down, earlier intervention

**SchooLinks solution**
- Course Planner aligns multi-year plan to graduation requirements; cohort-aware tracking:contentReference[oaicite:76]{index=76}
- KRI turns lagging indicators into leading predictors and supports drill-down/actionable insights:contentReference[oaicite:77]{index=77}:contentReference[oaicite:78]{index=78}

### 7.5 State-mandated plans (ILP/PLP/ECAP/HSBP/PGP)
**Common needs**
- Ensure every student completes required activities; guardian signatures; annual review

**SchooLinks solution**
- PLP stores mandated activities + captures guardian signatures + auto-completes from student activity work:contentReference[oaicite:79]{index=79}:contentReference[oaicite:80]{index=80}

---

## 8) Competitor landscape (and how SchooLinks differentiates)

### 8.1 Direct CCR competitors named in internal training/collateral
- **PowerSchool Naviance** (legacy market leader; “Naviance alternative” is a common search theme):contentReference[oaicite:81]{index=81}
- **Xello** (formerly Career Cruising):contentReference[oaicite:82]{index=82}
- **MajorClarity (by Paper)**:contentReference[oaicite:83]{index=83}
- **YouScience Brightpath**:contentReference[oaicite:84]{index=84}
- **Kuder Navigator**:contentReference[oaicite:85]{index=85}

> Note: Other competitors you mentioned (Levell, MaiaLearning, etc.) are not explicitly detailed in the excerpts retrieved here; an agent can still treat them as “CCR alternatives,” but avoid making specific claims without a sourced comparison.

### 8.2 SchooLinks’ key differentiators (the “why we win” set)
1) **Student-first design → organic adoption** (minimal training; modern UX; gamified elements):contentReference[oaicite:86]{index=86}  
2) **Digitize student activities** (digitally native workflows; real-time captured data):contentReference[oaicite:87]{index=87}  
3) **Live, actionable data for compliance** (democratize access; drill down by student/building/activity):contentReference[oaicite:88]{index=88}  
4) **Industry partner engagement** inside the platform:contentReference[oaicite:89]{index=89}  
5) **Everything in one place** (graduation tracking + WBL + alumni + wellness + CCR activities):contentReference[oaicite:90]{index=90}

### 8.3 Example: SchooLinks vs Xello (sourced differentiators)
From the SchooLinks vs Xello comparison collateral:
- SchooLinks emphasizes staff effectiveness and “one-of-a-kind reports,” including KRI + PLP to meet mandates:contentReference[oaicite:91]{index=91}
- Xello “does not offer any customization for reporting to meet these needs” (per internal comparison):contentReference[oaicite:92]{index=92}
- SchooLinks includes guardian plan signatures and broader staff tools in comparison tables:contentReference[oaicite:93]{index=93}
- For college readiness: SchooLinks highlights **scattergrams** (historical app data), FAFSA tracking, and richer college research tooling vs Xello (per comparison narrative):contentReference[oaicite:94]{index=94}

---

## 9) “Messaging blocks” the agent can reuse (high-performing phrasing)

### 9.1 One-liner
“SchooLinks is the all-in-one college & career readiness platform that helps districts support every student—college, career, or undecided—while giving staff real-time workflows and reporting to meet graduation and state accountability goals.”

### 9.2 If asked “How are you different?”
- “We’re designed for **student adoption** and **staff action**, not just reporting.”:contentReference[oaicite:95]{index=95}
- “We digitize your CCR activities so data is captured automatically and reported in real time.”:contentReference[oaicite:96]{index=96}
- “KRI turns compliance reporting into proactive intervention, with real-time drill-down.”:contentReference[oaicite:97]{index=97}
- “We unify college + career events (FAFSA nights, career fairs, rep visits) so it’s equitable for every student.”:contentReference[oaicite:98]{index=98}

### 9.3 If asked “Can we replace multiple vendors?”
Internal differentiator talk track explicitly argues against multiple platforms and lists: graduation tracking, industry partners, internships/placements with documentation, alumni tracking, and wellness in one platform.:contentReference[oaicite:99]{index=99}

---

## 10) Implementation + adoption notes (what to expect)
- Internal positioning stresses that CCR programs are only as successful as implementation; SchooLinks emphasizes customization to meet district needs and drive engagement + reporting ROI (in Xello comparison).:contentReference[oaicite:100]{index=100}
- The “Scope & Sequence” approach is repeatedly used as the adoption engine: define what students do, when they do it, and how reminders/To-Dos drive completion.:contentReference[oaicite:101]{index=101}

---

## 11) Safety rails for an AI agent (don’t overclaim)
When answering questions:
- **Do not claim exact district counts, adoption numbers, or precise competitor feature gaps** unless provided in a sourced document.
- If asked about competitors beyond Naviance/Xello/MajorClarity/YouScience/Kuder, respond at a high level (category-based) unless a sourced comparison is available.
- If asked about state-specific requirements, the safe move is: “SchooLinks supports state-mandated plan structures and can be updated for legislative changes,” which is directly supported by KRI/PLP collateral.:contentReference[oaicite:102]{index=102}:contentReference[oaicite:103]{index=103}

---

## 12) Quick reference: “Feature-to-initiative” mapping (from persona framework)
- **Increase Graduation** → Course Planner, KRI, Personalized Plan:contentReference[oaicite:104]{index=104}
- **Increase State Aligned Indicator Performance** → KRI (everyone):contentReference[oaicite:105]{index=105}
- **Increase Career Awareness / Exposure** → Career Center, opportunities, event scheduler, industry partner tools:contentReference[oaicite:106]{index=106}
- **Increase SEL** → CASEL-aligned lessons, check-ins, meeting tools, assessments:contentReference[oaicite:107]{index=107}

---

## 13) Suggested “default prompts” to train/search an AI agent on SchooLinks
Use these as test queries to validate the agent’s responses:
- “What makes SchooLinks different from Naviance or Xello?”
- “How does SchooLinks support FAFSA completion workflows?”
- “How can we track internships and WBL hours at scale?”
- “How do counselors see which students are off track for graduation?”
- “Does SchooLinks do course scheduling?”
- “How does SchooLinks support ILPs/ECAP/HSBP and parent signatures?”
- “What data sources feed KRI and how often do uploads happen?”

---

## Appendix A: Competitor ad/keyword context (optional, marketing-only)
Internal competitive ad analysis notes:
- Xello targets “Naviance alternative” style queries and seems to run limited PPC spend recently (per third-party tools referenced):contentReference[oaicite:108]{index=108}
- PowerSchool likely outspends others significantly in paid search (analysis framing):contentReference[oaicite:109]{index=109}
- MajorClarity positions as “one-stop CCR” and targets high-intent switching/compliance queries (analysis framing):contentReference[oaicite:110]{index=110}
